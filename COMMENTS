TO RUN:

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-dev
cd [path-to-code-dir]
python src/main.py
```

for expanded utility:
1. could include `argparser` and recieve the file locations via CL args
2. use a small rdbms (sqlite) or nosql and perform a "query"
3. create ORM and query
4. if 2 or 3, would want unit tests; pytest and coverage, and lint
